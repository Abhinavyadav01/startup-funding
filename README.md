## 🏗️ Data Architecture — Star Schema
 ![ Data Architecture]( docs/data_model.png)


 
**Why star schema?** Separates measures (amounts, deal counts) from descriptive context (sector, city, investor) — enabling fast aggregations in Power BI and clean DAX measure writing.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Process
 
### Stage 1 — Excel Pre-processing
- Renamed all columns to consistent snake_case
- Replaced string nulls (`"nan"`, `"N/A"`, `"unknown"`) with true blank cells
- Standardized city names — `Bangalore → Bengaluru`, `Gurgaon → Gurugram`
- Fixed slash-separated multi-location values — `"Bengaluru / USA" → "Bengaluru"`
- Added `country` column for international startup identification
### Stage 2 — Python / Pandas (Jupyter Notebook)
- **823 unique industry values** collapsed into **15 meaningful sectors** using keyword-based classification
- Fixed **110 startup name duplicates** — `"MamaEarth"`, `"Mamaearth"`, `"mamaearth"` → `"Mamaearth"` using most-frequent-variant logic
- Parsed date strings to datetime — extracted year, month, quarter
- Converted amount column from string to float — removed comma formatting, retained nulls as `NaN` (970 rows had genuinely undisclosed amounts)
- Filled categorical nulls: `industry_vertical → "Unclassified"`, `city → "Unknown"`, `investors_name → "Unknown"`
- Dropped irrelevant columns:  `remarks`
**Raw → Cleaned:**
 
| Metric | Raw | Cleaned |
|---|---|---|
| Unique sectors | 823 | 15 |
| Unique startup names | 2,449 | 2,339 |
| String nulls in amount | Mixed | True NaN |
| Column names | Inconsistent | snake_case |

## 📈 Dashboard Pages
 
### Page 1 — Overview: The Big Picture
*"India deployed ₹3,813 Cr across 3,035 deals between 2015–2019. Deal volume peaked in 2016 — but capital kept rising. The ecosystem wasn't shrinking. It was consolidating."*
 
- 5 KPI cards — Total Deals, Total Funding, Avg Deal Size, Top City, Top Sector
- Combo chart — Deal count (bars) vs Total Funding (line) by year
- Horizontal bar — Deals by sector with sector-specific colors
- Donut chart — Investment type breakdown
---
 
### Page 2 — Geography: Where India Builds
*"Three cities built modern India — but they built different things. Bengaluru won technology. Mumbai held finance. Delhi fuelled commerce."*
 
- City ranking horizontal bar — Top 8 cities by deal count
- Stacked bar — Sector composition per city (reveals each city's identity)
- Year slicer — filter geography by year

## 📐 DAX Measures
 
```dax
-- Total deals
TOTAL DEALS = COUNT(fact_funding[funding_id])
 
-- Total funding converted to Crores
TOTAL FUNDING = 
FORMAT(
    DIVIDE(SUM(fact_funding[amount_in_usd]), 10000000),
    "₹#,##0.0 Cr"
)
 
-- Average deal size in Crores
AVG DEAL SIZE = 
FORMAT(
    DIVIDE(
        AVERAGE(fact_funding[amount_in_usd]),
        10000000
    ),
    "₹#,##0.0 Cr"
)
 
-- YoY deal growth
YoY Deal Growth = 
VAR CurrentYear = CALCULATE(COUNT(fact_funding[funding_id]))
VAR PrevYear = 
    CALCULATE(
        COUNT(fact_funding[funding_id]),
        SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(dim_date[date])
    )
RETURN DIVIDE(CurrentYear - PrevYear, PrevYear)
 
-- Top city by deal count
TOP CITY = 
FIRSTNONBLANK(
    TOPN(
        1,
        VALUES(dim_startup[city /state location]),
        CALCULATE(COUNT(fact_funding[funding_id])),
        DESC
    ),
    1
)
 
-- Top sector by deal count
TOP SECTOR = 
FIRSTNONBLANK(
    TOPN(
        1,
        VALUES(dim_startup[industry_vertical]),
        CALCULATE(COUNT(fact_funding[funding_id])),
        DESC
    ),
    1
)
```

## 💡 What I Learned
 
- **Star schema design** separates concerns cleanly — dimensions describe, facts measure. This makes DAX measures significantly simpler to write.
- **Keyword-based sector classification** at scale (823 → 15 categories) requires ordering rules carefully — more specific keywords must be checked before broader ones to avoid misclassification.
- **Narrative-first dashboard design** — deciding the story before building visuals ensures every chart earns its place. Three visuals that prove a story beat ten visuals that just display data.
- **The 2017 divergence** was the most interesting finding — a market correction that was actually healthy. Fewer deals, larger checks = investors becoming more selective, not more fearful.
